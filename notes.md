# Notes For Class

Verify each vector class has the correct constness and reference type for constructors. Done

Verify argument types and return types of vector multiplication functions are correct. Done

Create constructors for converting different vec sizes to smaller and larger vec sizes. Going to a smaller vec size
should divide each element by the element being removed. Going to a larger size should set the new element to 1.
You can only go up and down one vec size at a time. This should still allow going up or down multiple vec sizes as
implicit conversions should allow a vec2 to be converted to a vec3 when using it in a vec3 to vec4 converter. Done

Try to get assignment working without needing an explicit assignment to a matrix function. Done
